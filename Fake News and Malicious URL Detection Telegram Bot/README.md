# Key Points

- This [Telegram Bot](https://github.com/Junaid-Nazir-828/ahmad_uk_twitter_spam_detection_bot) detects spam, fake news, and malicious URLs in X content shared in Telegram chats.
- It features commands like /start and /help, fake news detection using AI models, malicious URL identification, and real-time reporting for users.
- It is built with Python, python-telegram-bot library, and machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for detection models.

## Project Overview

This Telegram bot is designed to analyze X (formerly Twitter) content shared in Telegram chats for spam, fake news, and malicious URLs. It provides a command-based interface where users can interact with it, such as using /start or /help, and it processes shared X posts to flag potential issues, enhancing content moderation for community managers or individuals.

## Features

- Responds to commands like /start, /help, and possibly /analyze to trigger content checks.
- Detects fake news in X content using a machine learning model, ensuring credibility.
- Identifies malicious URLs in shared links, protecting users from harmful sites.
- Offers real-time reporting, flagging content as spam, fake, or malicious, and notifying users or admins.
