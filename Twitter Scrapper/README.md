# Key Points

- The desktop app, Twitter Scraper, is designed to scrape followers of a targeted username on Twitter (now X), requiring an auth token for access.
- It is built using Python, PyQt5 for the GUI, and Selenium for web scraping, making it a robust tool for data extraction.
- The app features a simple interface with input fields for the target username, number of users to scrape, and auth token, along with a "Start Scrape" button.

## Project Overview

Twitter Scraper is a desktop application that enables users to extract follower data from a specified Twitter (now X) username. It provides a straightforward interface for inputting the target username, the number of users to scrape, and an authentication token, then initiates the scraping process with a single click. This tool is useful for social media analysis, marketing research, or data collection, leveraging Python’s ecosystem for efficient scraping and GUI development.

## Features

Twitter Scraper includes:

- A user-friendly GUI with input fields for the target username, number of users to scrape, and auth token, as shown in the screenshot.
- A "Start Scrape" button to initiate the scraping process, making it accessible for non-technical users.
- Likely outputs scraped data (e.g., usernames, follower counts) to a file or display, inferred from typical scraping tools.
